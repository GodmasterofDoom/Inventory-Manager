# Inventory-Manager
## Purpose?
This is a simple inventory management app for household-items, especially groceries.
It is strictly purposed for **personal use**.
It is being created as an Android-App providing the frontend and some kind of database running on a homeserver as a backend.

Furthermore it is supposed to be a reentry for me back into the world of "real" software development.

## Implementation
The frontend is written mainly in Java using Googles Android Studio.
The implementation of the backend is yet to be determined.

## Usage
The app will include a barcode-scanner to scan EANs directly from products, although manual entry will be possible.
There will be the possibility to enter a "best-before"-date and select the amount that is being added to inventory.

## Possible future additions
Auto-set the best-before date for certain products (e.g. milk) based on experience.
Print out "shopping lists" for certain items that can be put in as "has to always be available".
